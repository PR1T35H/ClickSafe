# ClickSafe
 
## Introduction

**ClickSafe** is a project designed to combat the prevalent threat of phishing attacks, which are among the most common cyber-attacks today. Unlike traditional hacking methods that target system vulnerabilities, phishing relies on exploiting human errors through social engineering.

Our solution empowers users with tools that leverage machine learning to recognize intricate patterns that may go unnoticed by humans. Our machine learning model, trained on a dataset of over 10,000 samples, assesses URLs before users click on them, providing real-time predictions about their trustworthiness. Our website also offers features such as a list of potential phishing sites identified by our model and a search bar for users to assess suspicious URLs instantly.
